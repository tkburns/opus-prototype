(*
  The quintessential "Hello World" program
*)

!(print "Hello World");

(* ------------------- *)
(* we can also encapsulate it in a thunk *)

main = {
  !(print "Hello World")
};

!main;

(* ------------------- *)
(*
  the `print` function triggers the IO.write effect;
  by default it will print to stdout, but we can catch it
  and instead write to a file
*)

!main with
  IO.file.write './hello-world.txt';
